#+TITLE: TTY investigations
- Languages :: C, Rust, Python

Some real experiments around virtual terminals.

* Key logger

Put standard input in raw mode, and echo all characters received.
Exit when a =q= is encountered, and restore terminal state

* Other ideas

- =cat_pty=
  - Create a =pty= pair, and run =cat=
  - Exit when =q= is encountered, or when =cat= returns, and restore

- =sh_pty=
  - Run a shell, instead of =cat=

- Dyptik, a horizontal terminal duplexer
  - Each shell gets notified of winsize
  - Arrow keys decide which shell gets input (border gets highlighted)
